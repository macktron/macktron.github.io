# Policy Area

To help understand the nature of political alignment and divvision within the European Parliament, the roll-call votes categorized by legislative topic. Each voote is tagged with a policy area that describes its sustantive focus, allowing us to analyze trends within and across issue domains. These include:

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Budgetary Control</span> - 
    This policy  focuses on overseeing how the European Union's budget is spent. It includes votes on the discharge of annual budgets, audits of EU institutions, reports on financial irregularities, and recommendations for improved fiscal oversight. MEPs use these votes to examine and evaluate spending by the European Commission, European agencies, and other bodies to ensure accountability, transparency, and adherence to EU rules. While often technical, this domain reflects deeper political debates about institutional trust and financial governance.

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agriculture</span> - 
    This area includes votes on subsidies for farmers, environmental conditions for aid, food production standards, and rural development strategies. Agricultural policy is primarily governed through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), one of the EU's largest and most influential frameworks. The topic frequently highlights tensions between environmental sustainability, food security, and economic support for agricultural communities. It also brings into focus national interests, as agricultural priorities vary widely across member states.

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gender Equality</span> - 
    This policy focuses on eliminating discrimination and promoting fair treatment regardless of gender. MEPs vote on initiatives such as closing the gender pay gap, combatting gender-based violence, increasing female representation in political and corporate leadership, and ensuring work-life balance. These votes often intersect with broader debates on social justice, cultural norms, and human rights, with varying levels of support across political and regional lines.

  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">International Trade</span> - 
    This area involves the EU's commercial relationships with non-EU countries, including trade agreements, tariff policy, and regulatory cooperation. Votes often concern major trade deals (e.g., with Canada, Japan, or Mercosur), export controls, and trade sustainability clauses. This policy area illustrates ideological splits between support for liberalized global markets and calls for stronger protections for labor rights, environmental standards, and strategic industries.
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries</span> - 
      This area is governed by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), this domain includes legislation on the sustainable management of marine resources, fishing quotas, fleet regulation, and cooperation with non-EU countries on fishing rights.
      Fisheries policy is vital for coastal economies and often involves negotiations between ecological goals (e.g., preventing overfishing) and economic pressures from national fishing industries. This area can reveal regional divides, especially among member states with significant maritime sectors.
    
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Employment & Social Affairs</span> - 
      This topic covers EU legislation on labor markets, workers' rights, social protections, and inclusive employment policies.
      Votes address issues such as working conditions, minimum wages, occupational health and safety, social security coordination, and labor mobility. This area is ideologically charged, with progressive and centrist parties typically supporting stronger labor protections, while others advocate for labor market flexibility and reduced regulation.
    
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Environment & Public Health</span> - 
      A high-priority and expansive domain, this area includes votes on environmental regulation (e.g., climate change, biodiversity, pollution control) and health-related policies (e.g., pandemic preparedness, food safety, cross-border healthcare).
      MEPs debate legislative proposals aiming to balance ecological sustainability and public well-being with economic interests. Disagreement often arises over regulatory stringency, climate targets, and the role of innovation in solving environmental challenges.
    
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Development</span> - 
      Development policy focuses on the EU's engagement with lower-income countries through humanitarian aid, technical assistance, and economic partnerships.
      MEPs vote on funding for global development projects, EU contributions to international organizations, and programs promoting democracy, gender equality, education, and poverty reduction. The topic reflects the EU's identity as a normative global actor and often connects to broader foreign policy and trade agendas.
