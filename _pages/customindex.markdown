Where:
* %Y1 and %Y2 are the percentage of **Yes** votes in Group 1 and Group 2,
* %N1 and %N2 are the percentage of **No** votes,
* %A1 and %A2 are the percentage of **Abstain** votes.
* This approach allows us to capture how **similarly** two groups voted, rather than how **unified** they are internally.
