# Key Patterns in European Parliament Group Relationships

**Perfect alignment between Greens/EFAâ€“REG on Petitions (2013)**  
Complete cooperation (1.000) suggests petition matters transcend ideological boundaries. The [European Parliament's petition process](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/en/be-heard/petitions) allows citizens to raise concerns that affect them directly, creating a fundamental democratic connection point where diverse political groups find common ground.

**High cross-ideological cooperation on International Trade (2022)**  
Three top-scoring relationships (0.998-0.999) involve International Trade, indicating broad consensus on post-Brexit arrangements and global trade policies. This cooperation emerged despite traditional ideological differences, as both [EPP](https://www.eppgroup.eu/what-we-do/foreign-affairs/international-trade) and [Greens/EFA](https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/) supported trade policies with strong environmental and social protections.

**Consistent Greens/EFAâ€“S&D cooperation across policy areas**  
Stable high cooperation (0.996-0.998) across diverse policy areas from 2010-2022, confirming research showing these groups have high internal cohesion. According to [Cherepnalkoski et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5106041/), the Greens/EFA has consistently been one of the most cohesive political groups in the European Parliament.

**Zero cooperation between EPPâ€“REG on Employment (2017)**  
Complete opposition (0.000) on Employment and Social Affairs reflects fundamental disagreements on labor market regulation approaches. The [EPP Group](https://www.eppgroup.eu/what-we-do/economy-jobs-the-environment/employment-and-social-affairs) prioritized competitiveness and entrepreneurship while REG focused on worker protections, creating an unbridgeable policy divide.

**Low EPPâ€“S&D cooperation on Constitutional Affairs (2005-2007)**  
Minimal cooperation (0.001) during this period correlates with tensions following the rejection of the European Constitution in French and Dutch referendums. This represented a rare breakdown in the traditional ["grand coalition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_groups_of_the_European_Parliament) between these two largest groups.

**Temporal improvement in cooperation**  
Most low-cooperation scores occur in 2005-2007, while high-cooperation scores dominate in 2021-2022, suggesting increasing consensus-building capability in recent years. This trend reflects the Parliament's evolution toward more [issue-based rather than purely ideological voting patterns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament).

**Greens/EFA highest internal cohesion**  
Research shows Greens/EFA maintained 96% voting cohesion in the 8th Parliament (2014-2019), the highest among all political groups according to [Warasin et al. (2019)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-94012-6_1). This cohesion stems from shared environmental priorities and effective internal coordination mechanisms.
