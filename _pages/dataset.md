The dataset used in this project is sourced from **[VoteWatch Europe](https://www.votewatch.eu/)**, an independent organization that tracks voting behavior in the European Parliament. It captures how Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted::  **in favor**, **against**, or **abstained**‚Äîon legislative proposals. Alongside each vote, it includes rich metadata about the individual MEP and the vote context.

This allows for a detailed examination of voting patterns across countries, political groups, and time periods, offering insights into trends of polarization, party cohesion, and ideological shifts.
