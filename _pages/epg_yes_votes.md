# Yes votes per EPG over Policy Areas

This heatmap shows the percentage of **MEPs (Members of the European Parliament)** from each party group voting *"yes"* to legislation across different policy areas over time. It's a useful tool to visually grasp where party groups tend to agree or diverge in their policy preferences.

## Observed Patterns

* **IDG (Identity & Democracy)** and **NI (Non-Attached Members)** consistently show **low support** for most legislative proposals, especially on environmental, agricultural, and equality-related issues.
* In contrast, **Greens/EFA**, **S\&D**, and **Renew (REG)** tend to have higher "yes" rates-often aligning on progressive proposals.
* **Fisheries legislation in 2016** saw unusually high consensus across nearly all groups.
* **Agriculture in 2019** experienced a **notable spike in "no" votes**, particularly from Greens/EFA and S\&D.

### Why the Rejection of Agriculture Legislation in 2019?

In 2019, proposed reforms to the **Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)** were met with significant resistance from MEPs due to several reasons:

* **Environmental Concerns**: Critics said the CAP continued to subsidize industrial farming practices at odds with the EU's [Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en) and [Farm to Fork strategy](https://food.ec.europa.eu/horizontal-topics/farm-fork-strategy_en).
* **Lack of Ambition**: [Slow Food Europe](https://www.slowfood.com/press-releases/slow-food-the-eu-parliaments-vote-confirms-a-disastrous-common-agricultural-policy-which-continue-to-subsidize-an-industrial-destructive-and-unsustainable-farming-model/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and others argued the proposals did little to support small-scale farmers or biodiversity goals.
* **Farmer Backlash**: At the same time, [European farmers protested](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/10/theyre-drowning-us-in-regulations-how-europes-furious-farmers-took-on-brussels-and-won?utm_source=chatgpt.com), fearing new rules on pesticide and fertilizer reductions would harm their livelihoods.
