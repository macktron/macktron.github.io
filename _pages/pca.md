The clustering is performed using [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), a statistical technique that transforms complex, high-dimensional data into a simpler, more understandable form - typically two dimensions. Each European Parliamentary Group (EPG) casts thousands of votes across a wide range of issues, creating detailed patterns of behavior. PCA helps to detect overarching similarities in these patterns by identifying the most meaningful ways in which the groups differ or resemble each other.

By projecting this information into a two-dimensional space, PCA makes it possible to **visually compare** groups based on their overall voting behavior. Groups that appear closer together on the resulting map tend to vote in similar ways, while those farther apart exhibit more divergent behavior. This kind of visualization allows for a more intuitive understanding of polarization and alliances within the Parliament, without oversimplifying the complexity of the data.
